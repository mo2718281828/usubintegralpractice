Use this game to practice integrals with the technique of u-substitution.

Choose how many integrals you want to attempt (5, 10, 20, or MAX which will include all of the coded problems). For each integral, first select the best choice of u and du. Then select the result of the integral, written in terms of the original variable x. I recommend using pencil and paper to write the steps before looking at the answer options.

The highest possible score is 20 multiplied by the number of rounds. How many points can you earn?
